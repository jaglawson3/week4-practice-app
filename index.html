  			<h2>The Glorious Fail</h2>
  			<p>Fail, repeat, succeed, fail, succeed, repeat, fail, fail 7x7 times, succeed, fail smarter...and the cycle continues. With each added level of mastery comes a further recognition of the lack of knowledge one possesses. The true and terrifying recognition that one knows relatively nothing becomes a reality. To do anything well, it seems that failure is the most important thing. Fail smart though, don't fail stupid.</p>
  				<p>But isn't that the absolute best thing <em>to know.</em> Also to steal from agile philosophy, simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential. THis is very important in failing correctly. Fail with purpose!</p>

  					<h1>Mastery or Adaptibility?</h1>
  					<p>Javascript is an incredible language. It is simple and with fluency in it, one can rule almost any swath of the noosphere. However, given the broad applications of it, it seems nigh impossible to master every aspect of it without failing thousands of times. This entire work is a meditation on how to fail better.</p>

  					<p>Do you learn deep or do you learn wide?</p>

  					<p>With libraries and compilers, doo dads and hoo ha...why bother diving deep? Why not take the easy way out and just keep diving 6 inches deep into a million different things? Frankly, I would rather know a handful of things as deeply as I possibly can, than to know a little about everything.</p>

  				<p>This circular process seems the essence of deep learning. you wil fail millions of times for thousands of minutes, hours and days. Then one day, it will work. then fail and you carry on. A hard thing to continue doing. But, if true mastery is too occur, the crucibles of failue must be accepted. Seek failure as your teacher and your friend.</p>
